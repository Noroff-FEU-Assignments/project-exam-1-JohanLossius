<p>Product Passion is a blog created by Johan Lossius to feed into his strong interest in building incredible products, and to build off of his knowledge acquired from learning from successful business and tech people, visiting Silicon Valley, as well as partaking in the Noroff studies.</p>

<p>It was built with the purpose of being a blog that could actually be published and serve an audience way beyond the completion of the Noroff studies.</p>

<h2>General info about Product Passion</h2>
The site consists of three general parts:
<ul>
 <li>The blog itself. It exists to share the product development journey of selected people that are inspired and devoted product developers, aiming to achieve some degree of success within their field.</li>
 <li>The learning section. The purpose is to share essential third-party knowledge to succeed with product development and scaling businesses as well, curated to avoid bloat and maintain a high standard of quality.</li>
 <li>The community section. This section is not yet fully completed, but the intention is to create a vibrant community of product developers sharing knowledge and interacting with one another. Both for potential future collaborations, partnerships, recruitment, etc., as well as simply exchanging knowledge for better success for everyone involved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contributing:</h2>
<p>In order to contribute to this project, kindly share your thought process as you develop and / or design, with due explanation to your thought process, and documentation for your technical work where necessary. However, if the design and code is self-evident, which is the ideal, you don't have to document just for the sake of it. Keep it neat and clean, and remember that simple is better more often than not.</p>
<p>The idea behind the blog is to keep it playful, evoke emotions and energy in the followers, to inspire them to be rebellious, think differently, and to dare to follow their hearts. The design is built with that in mind, with the purpose of creating an army of passionate product developers for potential future collaborations.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements from Johan Lossius:</h2>
<p>I'd like to acknowledge Noroff for providing me with a great and flexible study so that I can keep learning while being busy with my own company. What I particularly liked was the pragmatism of the study, free from inapplicable theory that has no other use than to kill creativity, and full of pragmatic tools, tricks and knowledge to be used in the field of frontend development and design.</p>
<p>Also I'd liked to acknowledge the tutors that have helped me along, grading my work and providing feedback and tips when necessary.</p>
